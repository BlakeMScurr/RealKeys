    It'd be great to play all 3 chords one after another, but C is quite a big jump from F or G
/pause 1
    So we're going to use a trick called an "inversion" to make our C closer to our F and G

/play 1
    Here's the C major you're familiar with

/play 2-3
    Notice how similar it sounds to this chord called C major first inversion

/highlight 4/5
    If you look carefully at the two chords, we get C major first inversion by taking the C from the bottom of the chord, and putting at the top. That's why they sound so similar - they're using the exact same notes!
    /4
        Root position
    /5
        First inversion

/wait 6
    Start by playing E with your thumb

/wait 7
    Then add G with your first 2nd

/wait 8
    Then add C with your 5th

/wait 9
    And practice it a few times
