It'd be great to play all 3 chords one after another, but C is quite a big jump from F or G
So we're going to use a trick called an "inversion" to make our C closer to our F and G
Here's the C major you're familiar with

Notice how similar it sounds to this chord called C major first inversion. If you look carefully at the two chords, we get C major first inversion by taking the C from the bottom of the chord, and putting at the top. That's why they sound so similar - they're using the exact same notes! This is why it's called an inversion.
